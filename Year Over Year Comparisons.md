## Year Over Year Comparisons

 **Difficulty: Intermediate**

*Changes: Using Advenure Works OLTP 2019*

An executive requests data concerning fiscal quarter sales by salesperson. Sheâ€™d like to see comparisons from the fiscal quarters of 2008 to the same fiscal quarters of 2007.

For example, suppose sales for salesperson X totaled $1,000 during Fiscal Year 2008, Fiscal Quarter 2. If sales for salesperson X totaled $900 in Fiscal Year 2007, Fiscal Quarter 2, this reflects about 11.1% growth between the two periods for salesperson X.

Notes:
* For Adventure Works, the fiscal year spans July through June 
* Tax and freight will not be considered with revenue
* Dates are based on OrderDate
* Disregard online orders


Your output should include the following columns, corresponding to all sales people:
* LastName
* SalesPersonID
* Fiscal year
* Fiscal quarter
* Fiscal quarter sales
* Sales during the same fiscal quarter of the previous fiscal year Change in revenue between the two periods
* Percent change in revenue between the two periods

### My Solution

```
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT SalesPersonID
         , YEAR(DATEADD(MONTH, 6, OrderDate))              [Fiscal Year]
         , DATEPART(QUARTER, DATEADD(MONTH, 6, OrderDate)) [Fiscal Quarter]
         , SUM(SubTotal)                                   [Fiscal Quarter Sales]
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    WHERE OnlineOrderFlag = 0
    GROUP BY SalesPersonID, IIF(MONTH(OrderDate) <= 6, YEAR(OrderDate) - 1, YEAR(OrderDate))
           , DATEPART(QUARTER, DATEADD(MONTH, 6, OrderDate))
)
SELECT LastName
     , CTE.SalesPersonID
     , CTE.[Fiscal Year]
     , CTE.[Fiscal Quarter]
     , CTE.[Fiscal Quarter Sales]
     , Previous.[Fiscal Quarter Sales]                                                                        [Previous Year Fiscal Quarter Sales]
     , CTE.[Fiscal Quarter Sales] - Previous.[Fiscal Quarter Sales]                                           [Change]
     , (CTE.[Fiscal Quarter Sales] - Previous.[Fiscal Quarter Sales]) / Previous.[Fiscal Quarter Sales] * 100 [% Change]
FROM CTE
         INNER JOIN Person.Person
                    ON Person.BusinessEntityID = CTE.SalesPersonID
         LEFT JOIN CTE Previous
                   ON Previous.SalesPersonID = CTE.SalesPersonID
                       AND Previous.[Fiscal Year] = CTE.[Fiscal Year] - 1
                       AND Previous.[Fiscal Quarter] = CTE.[Fiscal Quarter]
WHERE CTE.[Fiscal Year] = 2013;
```

### What I Learned
* More practice using `DATEPART()` and `DATEADD()`.
* Remember, it's okay to use CTEs instead of trying to avoid them because of more code.
